# Robot Robocode
Read about [Robocode here](http://robocode.sourceforge.net/).
This project began when I was bored and decided to combine fun and learning (;. So I wrote code for my robot to play with my Mentor.

    My bot is able to defeat all opponents from default packs. 
    Win/Lose ratio (rounds) ratio is about 75% 
    Win/Lose ratio (whole match) ratio is about 90-95% 

Wrote in pure Java and Robocode API.
